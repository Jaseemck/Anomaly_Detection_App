# Anomaly Detection in IoT Devices

This project demonstrates the EDA of [kaggle IoT dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/francoisxa/ds2ostraffictraces ), and [KDD cup dataset](https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) and modeling of Anomaly detection into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app. The details of the project, source code, paper and the approach is also included in the app.
